          For me, sometimes it feels like this constant buzzing in the back of
          my mind, a worry that just won't quit. Other times, it can be more
          physical â€“ like my heart racing before a presentation or feeling
          restless when I have a lot on my plate. It's not always a huge,
          dramatic thing; sometimes it's just this low-level unease that hangs
          around.
